Write a test for the login page: http://localhost:5173/admin/sys/user/userPage
1. Put your code in tests folder, the filename should be userPage.spec.ts.
2. Use playwright to write the test.
3. Use typescript for your code.
4. Write as more test cases as you can.
5. You should log in first, refer to tests/login.spec.ts, and since other pages may need to log in too, please follow the `dry(don't repeat yourself)` principle.
6. Use `pnpm exec playwright test --project=chromium tests/userPage.spec.ts`
