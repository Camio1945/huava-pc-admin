Edit vue files in src/views/sys, for every element that inside an el-form-item (note not the el-form-item itself, but the element inside it), add an id attribute for it with an appropriate name.
There are 2 types of form:
1. The form for query parameters. The id name for this form should be like: q-<paramName>, for example: q-phoneNumber
2. The form for adding or editing. The id name for this form should be the same value of the `prop` attribute of the el-form-item.
