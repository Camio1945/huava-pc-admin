The two red IDE warnings in src/permission.ts occur due to TypeScript's inability to properly infer types in circular references:

1. `findDashboardRoute implicitly has return type any` - This happens because the function references itself in one of its return expressions, creating a circular dependency that TypeScript can't resolve without explicit type annotations.

2. `found implicitly has type any` - This occurs when a variable is referenced in its own initializer, creating a circular reference that TypeScript can't infer types for.

To fix these issues:
1. Add explicit return type annotations to functions that reference themselves in their return expressions
2. Provide explicit type annotations for variables that reference themselves in their initializers
3. Break circular dependencies where possible by restructuring the code

For example:
- Change `const findDashboardRoute = (...) => { ... }` to `const findDashboardRoute: RouteType = (...) => { ... }` with an appropriate interface/type definition
- Add explicit types to variables like `let found: boolean | RouteRecordRaw = false`
