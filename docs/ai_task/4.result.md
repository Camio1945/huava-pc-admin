The red IDE warning "Vue: Cannot find module ./App.vue or its corresponding type declarations" occurs because TypeScript cannot find the type declaration for `.vue` files. The IDE (likely VSCode) expects a type declaration file for Vue SFCs (Single File Components) to properly recognize them as modules.

To fix this issue, you need to add a type declaration for `.vue` files. Create a file named `shims-vue.d.ts` or add the following declaration to your existing `global.d.ts` file:

```typescript
declare module '*.vue' {
  import type { DefineComponent } from 'vue'
  const component: DefineComponent<{}, {}, any>
  export default component
}
```

In this project, you can add it to the existing `global.d.ts` file located at `/home/camio/git/huava/huava-pc-admin/global.d.ts`.

After adding this declaration, restart your IDE to clear the cache and the warning should disappear.
