The reason `await page.goto('/admin/login')` works without needing to add `http://localhost:5173` is because of the `baseURL` configuration in your Playwright configuration file (`playwright.config.ts`).

In the configuration, you have:

```typescript
use: {
  /* Base URL to use in actions like `await page.goto('')`. */
  baseURL: 'http://localhost:5173',
  // ...
},
```

When you set a `baseURL` in Playwright, it automatically prepends that URL to any relative paths you use in navigation methods like `page.goto()`. So when you call `page.goto('/admin/login')`, Playwright automatically resolves it to `http://localhost:5173/admin/login`.

This is a convenient feature that allows you to write cleaner test code without having to repeat the full URL everywhere, and it also makes your tests more portable since you can change the base URL in one place if needed.
